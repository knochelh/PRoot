Release v2.2
============

* This release brings some critical fixes so an upgrade is highly
  recommended, especially on x86_64 and Ubuntu.

* PRoot is now a lot faster: the speed-up can be up to 50% depending
  on the kind of application.

* PRoot can now mount/bind files anywhere in the guest rootfs, even if
  the mount point has no parent directory (and/or can't be created).
  With previous versions of PRoot, that would created kinda black hole
  in the filesystem hierarchy that might bug some programs like "cpio"
  or "rpm".

  For example, with the previous version of PRoot::

       $ proot -b /etc/motd:/black/holes/and/revelations
       proot warning: can't create the guest path (binding) ...
       proot info: started

       $ find /black
       find: `/black: No such file or directory

       $ cat /black/holes/and/revelations
       Time has come to make things right -- Matthew Bellamy

  And now::

       $ proot -b /etc/motd:/black/holes/and/revelations
       proot info: started

       $ find /black
       /black
       /black/holes
       /black/holes/and
       /black/holes/and/revelations

       $ cat /black/holes/and/revelations
       Time has come to make things right -- Matthew Bellamy

* "/run" was added to the list of recommended bindings (-B/-Q).

* SH4 and ARM architectures are now officially supported.

Thanks

Huge thanks to RÃ©mi DURAFFORT for all the tests, bug reports, fixes,
and for hosting http://proot.me.

Thanks to Thomas P. HIGDON for the advanced investigation on a really
tricky bug (red zone corruption).


Release v2.1
============

New features
------------

* PRoot can now emulate some of the syscalls that are available in the
  kernel release specified by -k but that are missing in the host
  kernel.  This allows the execution of guest programs expecting a
  kernel newer than the actual one, if you encountered the famous
  "FATAL: kernel too old" or "qemu: Unsupported syscall" messages.

* The current working directory isn't changed anymore if it is still
  accessible in the guest environment (binding).

Fixes
-----

* Added support for architectures with no misalignment support (SH4).

* Fix support for: link(2), linkat(2), symlink(2), and symlinkat(2).


Release v2.0.1
==============

* Fix a compatibility issue with QEMU v1.1

* Fix the initialization of bindings that point to "/proc/self".

These problems were reported by Alkino:

    https://github.com/cedric-vincent/PRoot/issues/3


Release v2.0
============

New features
------------

* There's now a specific support to handle special symlinks in /proc.
  As of now, only the following ones are correctly handled:

      * /proc/self, it was already supported previously but now this
        is done consistently (i.e. not a hack);

      * /proc/<PID>/exe, for any <PID> monitored by PRoot; and

      * /proc/<PID>/fd/<FD>.

* The list of supported syscalls was updated, as of Linux 3.4.1.

Command-line interface changes
------------------------------

* The path to the guest rootfs can now be specified by the new
  -r/--rootfs option.  This permits the use of shell aliases, for
  example:

      $ alias armedslack='proot -Q qemu-arm -r /path/to/armedslack'
      $ armedslack -v 1 -b ~/arm_cpuinfo:/proc/cpuinfo

  That wasn't possible previously because the path to the guest rootfs
  had to be the last option.

* The -v/--verbose option now takes a parameter, and a negative
  integer makes PRoot quiet except on fatal errors.

* The -h/--help option now prints a detailed message.

* The -V/--version and -h/--help options now exit with success.

Fix
---

* Return correct errno if a non-final path component isn't a directory
  nor a symlink.

* Fix the insertion of an item in the list of host/guest bindings.


Internal changes
----------------

This section is dedicated to PRoot developers.

* File-system information is now inherited from a traced process to
  its children.  This permits the emulation of symlinks in /proc/self:
  cmdline, exe, cwd, root, ...

* The execution of QEMU is now fully confined to the virtual rootfs
  namespace: it now relies on the "mixed-execution" feature, just like
  a regular host program.


Release v1.9
============

Fixes
-----

* Be as transparent as possible with respect to SIGSTOP and SIGTRAP
  signals.  For instance, the Open POSIX Test Suite now reports the
  same level of success whether it is run under PRoot or not (it
  depends on the kernel version though).

* Ignore terminating signals and kill all tracees on abnormal
  termination signals (^\, segmentation fault, divide by zero, ...).
  This ensures no tracee will stay alive without being monitored
  anymore.

* Force utsname.machine to "i686" -- instead of "i386" -- for 32-bit
  programs running on x86_64 systems.  This improves the compatibility
  with package managers that deduce the current architecture from
  `uname -m`.

* Fix x86_64 support for linkat() and fchownat().

* Fix mixed-execution support, LD_LIBRARY_PATH was defined twice for
  host programs.


Release v1.8.4
==============

New feature
-----------

* The -0 option now fakes success on ``chroot("/")``.  This feature is
  required by some guest package managers, like ``pacman`` -- the Arch
  Linux Package Manager.

Fix
---

* Nested bindings are now correctly supported.  For example with these
  bindings -- nested from the host point-of-view::

      host$ proot -b /:/host-rootfs -b /tmp ...
      guest$ ln -s /tmp/bar /tmp/foo
      # ... points to "/tmp/bar" instead of "/host-rootfs/tmp/bar"

  and with these bindings -- nested from the guest point-of-view::

      host$ proot -b /bin -b /usr/bin/find:/bin/find ...
      guest$ /bin/find
      # ... works instead of "no such file or directory"

Internal changes
----------------

This section is dedicated to PRoot developers.

* Functions to compare two pathes (equal, prefix, not comparable, ...)
  are now available, at last.

* The "ignore ELF interpreter" option can be (dis|en)able with the
  ``PROOT_IGNORE_ELF_INTERPRETER`` environment variable and/or with
  the ``config.ignore_elf_interpreter`` internal variable.


Release v1.8.3
==============

New features
------------

* The -0 option now fakes success on ownership changes.  This improves
  the compatibility with package managers that abort if ``chown(2)``
  fails.  Note that this is quite limited compared to ``fakeroot``.

* Force utsname.machine to "i386" for 32-bit programs running on
  x86_64 systems.  This improves the compatibility with package
  managers that deduce the current architecture from `uname -m`.

Fixes
-----

* Fix a regression regarding the concatenation of the ``..`` with a
  path ending with ``.``.  For intance you can now do ``ls foo`` where
  ``foo`` is a symbolic link to ``/bar/.``.

* Don't return an error if the specified size for ``getcwd(2)`` and
  ``readlink(2)`` is greater than PATH_MAX.  Technically the result
  may likely be shorter than this limit.


Release v1.8.2
==============

* This is the first public release of PRoot, it's time to increase its
  maturity artificially ...  Actually it's an homage to Blink 182 ;)

* User manual finally published.

* PRoot can now *mix* the execution of host programs and the execution
  of guest programs emulated by QEMU.  This is useful to use programs
  that aren't available initially in the guest environment and to
  speed up build-time by using cross-compilation tools or any CPU
  independent program, like interpreters.

* Absolute symlinks from bound directories that point to any bound
  directory are kept consistent: for example, given the host symlink
  ``/bin/sh -> /bin/bash``, and given the command-line option ``-b
  /bin:/foo``, the symlink will appeared as ``/foo/sh -> /foo/bash``.

* Three command-line options are gone:

  * ``-p`` (don't block the ptrace syscall) wasn't really useful.

  * ``-e`` (don't use the ELF interpreter) isn't required anymore.

  * ``-a`` (disable the ASLR mechanism) is now the default.

* Don't complain anymore when parent directories of a *recommended
  binding* (as enabled by ``-B``, ``-M`` and ``-Q`` options) can't be
  created.

* Support job control under ptrace as introduced in Linux 3.0+.

* ``LD_`` environment variables are now passed to the QEMUlated
  program, not to QEMU itself.  It means ``ldd`` works (there's a bug
  in QEMU/ARM though).

* Many fixes and improved compatibility thanks to the Open Build
  Service instantiated at http://build.opensuse.com

* Note: v0.7.1 was an experimental release.


Release v0.7.0
==============

* Search the guest program in $PATH relatively to the guest rootfs,
  for instance you can now just write::

      proot /path/to/guest/rootfs/  perl

  instead of::

      proot /path/to/guest/rootfs/  /usr/bin/perl

* The command-line interface was re-written from scratch, the only
  incompatible change is that QEMU options are now separated by
  spaces::

     proot -Q "qemu-arm -g 1234" ...

  instead of::

     proot -Q qemu-arm,-g,1234 ...

* New option "-0": force syscalls "get*id" to report identity 0, aka
  "root".

* Many fixes, code refactoring, new testing framework, ...

Special thanks to Claire ROBINE for her contribution.


Release v0.6.2
==============

* Change the default command from $SHELL to "/bin/sh".  The previous
  behaviour led to an unexpected error -- from user's point-of-view --
  when $SHELL didn't exit in the new root file-system.

* Fix *partially* support for readlink(2) when mirror pathes are in
  use.  Prior this patch, any symbolic link -- that points to an
  absolute path which prefix is equal to the host-side of any mirror
  path -- was bugged.  For instance, the command "proot -m /bin:/host
  $ROOTFS /usr/bin/readlink /usr/bin/ps" returned "/host" instead of
  "/bin/ps".

* Add the option "-V" to print the version then exit.

* Be more explicit when a wrong command-line argument is used.

* Remove the SIGSEGV help message: it was too confusing to the user.

* Use a new shining build-system (again :D).

Special thanks go to those contributors: Yves JANIN, Remi Duraffort
and Christophe GUILLON.


Release v0.6.1
==============

* Add `/tmp` to the list of mirrored paths when using -M.

* Fix the ELF interpreter extraction.

* Rewrite the build system.


Release v0.6
============

New features
------------

* Added support for "asymmetric" path mirrors.

    The command-line option for mirrors was extended to support the
    syntax "-m <p1>:<p2>" where <p1> is the location of the mirror
    within the alternate rootfs and <p2> is the path to the real
    directory/file.  For instance you can now mirror the whole host
    rootfs in the directory "/hostfs" within the alternate rootfs that
    way::

        proot -m /:/hostfs ...

* Added an option to disable ASLR (Address Space Layout
  Randomization).

    RHEL4 and Ubuntu 10.04 use an ASLR mechanism that creates
    conflicts between the layout of QEMU and the layout of the target
    program.  This new option is automatically set when QEMU is used.

* Added "/etc/resolv.conf" and $HOME to the list of mirrored paths
  when using the option -M or -Q.

Fixes
-----

* Fixed the detranslation of getcwd(2) and readlink(2).

* Improved the build compatibility on old/broken distro.

* Added support for pthread cancellation when QEMU is used.

* Set QEMU's fake argv[0] to the program actually launched, not to the
  initial script name.

* Create the path up to the mirror location to cheat "walking"
  programs.
