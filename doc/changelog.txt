Release v1.8.3
==============

New features
------------

* The -0 option now fakes success on ownership changes.  This improves
  the compatibility with package managers that abort if ``chown(2)``
  fails.  Note that this is quite limited compared to ``fakeroot``.

* Force utsname.machine to "i386" for 32-bit programs running on
  x86_64 systems.  This improves the compatibility with package
  managers that deduce the current architecture from `uname -m`.

Fixes
-----

* Fix a regression regarding the concatenation of the ``..`` with a
  path ending with ``.``.  For intance you can now do ``ls foo`` where
  ``foo`` is a symbolic link to ``/bar/.``.

* Don't return an error if the specified size for ``getcwd(2)`` and
  ``readlink(2)`` is greater than PATH_MAX.  Technically the result
  may likely be shorter than this limit.


Release v1.8.2
==============

* This is the first public release of PRoot, it's time to increase its
  maturity artificially ...  Actually it's an homage to Blink 182 ;)

* User manual finally published.

* PRoot can now *mix* the execution of host programs and the execution
  of guest programs emulated by QEMU.  This is useful to use programs
  that aren't available initially in the guest environment and to
  speed up build-time by using cross-compilation tools or any CPU
  independent program, like interpreters.

* Absolute symlinks from bound directories that point to any bound
  directory are kept consistent: for example, given the host symlink
  ``/bin/sh -> /bin/bash``, and given the command-line option ``-b
  /bin:/foo``, the symlink will appeared as ``/foo/sh -> /foo/bash``.

* Three command-line options are gone:

  * ``-p`` (don't block the ptrace syscall) wasn't really useful.

  * ``-e`` (don't use the ELF interpreter) isn't required anymore.

  * ``-a`` (disable the ASLR mechanism) is now the default.

* Don't complain anymore when parent directories of a *recommended
  binding* (as enabled by ``-B``, ``-M`` and ``-Q`` options) can't be
  created.

* Support job control under ptrace as introduced in Linux 3.0+.

* ``LD_`` environment variables are now passed to the QEMUlated
  program, not to QEMU itself.  It means ``ldd`` works (there's a bug
  in QEMU/ARM though).

* Many fixes and improved compatibility thanks to the Open Build
  Service instantiated at http://build.opensuse.com

* Note: v0.7.1 was an experimental release.


Release v0.7.0
==============

* Search the guest program in $PATH relatively to the guest rootfs,
  for instance you can now just write::

      proot /path/to/guest/rootfs/  perl

  instead of::

      proot /path/to/guest/rootfs/  /usr/bin/perl

* The command-line interface was re-written from scratch, the only
  incompatible change is that QEMU options are now separated by
  spaces::

     proot -Q "qemu-arm -g 1234" ...

  instead of::

     proot -Q qemu-arm,-g,1234 ...

* New option "-0": force syscalls "get*id" to report identity 0, aka
  "root".

* Many fixes, code refactoring, new testing framework, ...

Special thanks to Claire ROBINE for her contribution.


Release v0.6.2
==============

* Change the default command from $SHELL to "/bin/sh".  The previous
  behaviour led to an unexpected error -- from user's point-of-view --
  when $SHELL didn't exit in the new root file-system.

* Fix *partially* support for readlink(2) when mirror pathes are in
  use.  Prior this patch, any symbolic link -- that points to an
  absolute path which prefix is equal to the host-side of any mirror
  path -- was bugged.  For instance, the command "proot -m /bin:/host
  $ROOTFS /usr/bin/readlink /usr/bin/ps" returned "/host" instead of
  "/bin/ps".

* Add the option "-V" to print the version then exit.

* Be more explicit when a wrong command-line argument is used.

* Remove the SIGSEGV help message: it was too confusing to the user.

* Use a new shining build-system (again :D).

Special thanks go to those contributors: Yves JANIN, Remi Duraffort
and Christophe GUILLON.


Release v0.6.1
==============

* Add `/tmp` to the list of mirrored paths when using -M.

* Fix the ELF interpreter extraction.

* Rewrite the build system.


Release v0.6
============

New features
------------

* Added support for "asymmetric" path mirrors.

    The command-line option for mirrors was extended to support the
    syntax "-m <p1>:<p2>" where <p1> is the location of the mirror
    within the alternate rootfs and <p2> is the path to the real
    directory/file.  For instance you can now mirror the whole host
    rootfs in the directory "/hostfs" within the alternate rootfs that
    way::

        proot -m /:/hostfs ...

* Added an option to disable ASLR (Address Space Layout
  Randomization).

    RHEL4 and Ubuntu 10.04 use an ASLR mechanism that creates
    conflicts between the layout of QEMU and the layout of the target
    program.  This new option is automatically set when QEMU is used.

* Added "/etc/resolv.conf" and $HOME to the list of mirrored paths
  when using the option -M or -Q.

Fixes
-----

* Fixed the detranslation of getcwd(2) and readlink(2).

* Improved the build compatibility on old/broken distro.

* Added support for pthread cancellation when QEMU is used.

* Set QEMU's fake argv[0] to the program actually launched, not to the
  initial script name.

* Create the path up to the mirror location to cheat "walking"
  programs.
