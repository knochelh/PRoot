.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBproot\fP [\fIoption\fP] ... [\fIcommand\fP]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
PRoot is a user\-space implementation of \fBchroot\fP, \fBmount \-\-bind\fP,
and \fBbinfmt_misc\fP.  This means that users don\(aqt need any privileges
or setup to do things like using an arbitrary directory as the new
root filesystem, making files accessible somewhere else in the
filesystem hierarchy, or executing programs built for another CPU
architecture transparently through QEMU user\-mode.  Also, developers
can add their own features or use PRoot as a Linux process
instrumentation engine thanks to its extension mechanism.  Technically
PRoot relies on \fBptrace\fP, an unprivileged system\-call available in
every Linux kernel.
.sp
The new root file\-system, a.k.a \fIguest rootfs\fP, typically contains a
Linux distribution.  By default PRoot confines the execution of
programs to the guest rootfs only, however users can use the built\-in
\fImount/bind\fP mechanism to access files and directories from the actual
root file\-system, a.k.a \fIhost rootfs\fP, just as if they were part of
the guest rootfs.
.sp
When the guest Linux distribution is made for a CPU architecture
incompatible with the host one, PRoot uses the CPU emulator QEMU
user\-mode to execute transparently guest programs.  It\(aqs a convenient
way to develop, to build, and to validate any guest Linux packages
seamlessly on users\(aq computer, just as if they were in a \fInative\fP
guest environment.  That way all of the cross\-compilation issues are
avoided.
.sp
PRoot can also \fImix\fP the execution of host programs and the execution
of guest programs emulated by QEMU user\-mode.  This is useful to use
host equivalents of programs that are missing from the guest rootfs
and to speed up build\-time by using cross\-compilation tools or
CPU\-independent programs, like interpreters.
.sp
It is worth noting that the guest kernel is never involved, regardless
of whether QEMU user\-mode is used or not.  Technically, when guest
programs perform access to system resources, PRoot translates their
requests before sending them to the host kernel.  This means that
guest programs can use host resources (devices, network, ...) just as
if they were "normal" host programs.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
The command\-line interface is composed of two parts: first PRoot\(aqs
options (optional), then the command to launch (\fB/bin/sh\fP if not
specified).  This section describes the options supported by PRoot,
that is, the first part of its command\-line interface.
.SS Regular options
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.BI \-r \ path, \ \-\-rootfs\fB= path
Use \fIpath\fP as the new guest root file\-system, default is \fB/\fP.
.sp
The specified \fIpath\fP typically contains a Linux distribution where
all new programs will be confined.  The default rootfs is \fB/\fP
when none is specified, this makes sense when the bind mechanism
is used to relocate host files and directories, see the \fB\-b\fP
option and the \fBExamples\fP section for details.
.TP
.BI \-b \ path, \ \-\-bind\fB= path, \ \-m \ path, \ \-\-mount\fB= path
Make the content of \fIpath\fP accessible in the guest rootfs.
.sp
This option makes any file or directory of the host rootfs
accessible in the confined environment just as if it were part of
the guest rootfs.  By default the host path is bound to the same
path in the guest rootfs but users can specify any other location
with the syntax: \fB\-b *host_path*:*guest_location*\fP.
.TP
.BI \-q \ command, \ \-\-qemu\fB= command
Execute guest programs through QEMU as specified by \fIcommand\fP.
.sp
Each time a guest program is going to be executed, PRoot inserts
the QEMU user\-mode \fIcommand\fP in front of the initial request.
That way, guest programs actually run on a virtual guest CPU
emulated by QEMU user\-mode.  The native execution of host programs
is still effective and the whole host rootfs is bound to
\fB/host\-rootfs\fP in the guest environment.
.sp
This option is automatically enabled by the \fB\-Q\fP option.
.TP
.BI \-w \ path, \ \-\-pwd\fB= path, \ \-\-cwd\fB= path
Set the initial working directory to \fIpath\fP.
.sp
Some programs expect to be launched from a given directory but do
not perform any \fBchdir\fP by themselves.  This option avoids the
need for running a shell and then entering the directory manually.
.TP
.BI \-v \ value, \ \-\-verbose\fB= value
Set the level of debug information to \fIvalue\fP.
.sp
The higher the integer \fIvalue\fP is, the more detailled debug
information is printed to the standard error stream.  A negative
\fIvalue\fP makes PRoot quiet except on fatal errors.
.TP
.B \-V,  \-\-version,  \-\-about
Print version, copyright, license and contact, then exit.
.TP
.B \-h,  \-\-help,  \-\-usage
Print the version and the command\-line usage, then exit.
.UNINDENT
.SS Extension options
.sp
The following options enable built\-in extensions.  Technically
developers can add their own features to PRoot or use it as a Linux
process instrumentation engine thanks to its extension mechanism, see
the sources for further details.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.BI \-k \ string, \ \-\-kernel\-release\fB= string
Set the kernel release and compatibility level to \fIstring\fP.
.sp
If a program is run on a kernel older than the one expected by its
GNU C library, the following error is reported: "FATAL: kernel too
old".  To be able to run such programs, PRoot can emulate some of
the syscalls that are available in the kernel release specified by
\fIstring\fP but that are missing in the current kernel.
.TP
.B \-0,  \-\-root\-id
Force some syscalls to behave as if executed by "root".
.sp
Some programs will refuse to work if they are not run with "root"
privileges, even if there is no technical reason for that.  This
is typically the case with package managers.  This option allows
users to bypass this kind of limitation by faking the user/group
identity, and by faking the success of some operations like
changing the ownership of files, changing the root directory to
\fB/\fP, ...  Note that this option is quite limited compared to
\fBfakeroot\fP.
.UNINDENT
.SS Alias options
.sp
The following options are aliases for handy sets of options.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-B,  \-M
Alias: \fB\-b\fP for each path of a recommended list
.sp
There are a couple of bindings that are needed for most guest
programs to behave correctly regarding the configuration part of
the host computer which is not specific to the host Linux
distribution, such as: user/group information, network setup,
run\-time information, users\(aq files, ... This highly recommended
option enables the following bindings:
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
/etc/host.conf
.IP \(bu 2
/etc/hosts
.IP \(bu 2
/etc/hosts.equiv
.IP \(bu 2

.IP \(bu 2
$HOME
.UNINDENT
.TP
.BI \-Q \ command
Alias: \fB\-q *command* \-B\fP
.sp
This option is highly recommended when using QEMU user\-mode; it
enables all the recommended bindings.
.UNINDENT
.SH EXIT STATUS
.sp
If an internal error occurs, \fBproot\fP returns a non\-zero exit status,
otherwise it returns the exit status of the last terminated
program. When an error has occurred, the only way to know if it comes
from the last terminated program or from \fBproot\fP itself is to have a
look at the error message.
.SH FILES
.sp
PRoot reads links in \fB/proc/<pid>/fd/\fP to support \fIopenat(2)\fP\-like
syscalls made by the guest programs.
.SH EXAMPLES
.sp
In the following examples the directories \fB/mnt/slackware\-8.0\fP and
\fB/mnt/armslack\-12.2/\fP contain a Linux distribution respectively made
for x86 CPUs and ARM CPUs.
.SS \fBchroot\fP equivalent
.sp
To execute a command inside a given Linux distribution, just give
\fBproot\fP the path to the guest rootfs followed by the desired
command.  The example below executes the program \fBcat\fP to print the
content of a file:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
proot \-r /mnt/slackware\-8.0/ cat /etc/motd

Welcome to Slackware Linux 8.0
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The default command is \fB/bin/sh\fP when none is specified. Thus the
shortest way to confine an interactive shell and all its sub\-programs
is:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
proot \-r /mnt/slackware\-8.0/

$ cat /etc/motd
Welcome to Slackware Linux 8.0
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS \fBmount \-\-bind\fP equivalent
.sp
The bind mechanism permits to relocate files and directories.  This is
typically useful to cheat programs that perform access to hard\-coded
locations, like some installation scripts:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
proot \-b /tmp/alternate_opt:/opt

$ cd to/sources
$ make install
[...]
install \-m 755 prog "/opt/bin"
[...] # prog is installed in "/tmp/alternate_opt/bin" actually
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
As shown in this example, it is possible to bind over files not even
owned by the user.  This can be used to \fIoverlay\fP system configuration
files, for instance the DNS setting:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
ls \-l /etc/hosts
\-rw\-r\-\-r\-\- 1 root root 675 Mar  4  2011 /etc/hosts
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
proot \-b ~/alternate_hosts:/etc/hosts

$ echo \(aq1.2.3.4 google.com\(aq > /etc/hosts
$ resolveip google.com
IP address of google.com is 1.2.3.4
$ echo \(aq5.6.7.8 google.com\(aq > /etc/hosts
$ resolveip google.com
IP address of google.com is 5.6.7.8
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS \fBchroot\fP + \fBmount \-\-bind\fP equivalent
.sp
The two features above can be combined to make any file from the host
rootfs accessible in the confined environment just as if it were
initially part of the guest rootfs.  It is sometimes required to run
programs that rely on some specific files:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
proot \-r /mnt/slackware\-8.0/

$ ps \-o tty,command
Error, do this: mount \-t proc none /proc
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
works better with:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
proot \-r /mnt/slackware\-8.0/ \-b /proc

$ ps \-o tty,command
TT       COMMAND
?        \-bash
?        proot \-b /proc /mnt/slackware\-8.0/
?        /lib/ld\-linux.so.2 /bin/sh
?        /lib/ld\-linux.so.2 /usr/bin/ps \-o tty,command
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Actually there\(aqs a bunch of such specific files, that\(aqs why PRoot
provides the option \fB\-B\fP to bind automatically a pre\-defined list of
recommended paths:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
proot \-r /mnt/slackware\-8.0/ \-B

$ ps \-o tty,command
TT       COMMAND

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SS \fBchroot\fP + \fBmount \-\-bind\fP + \fBbinfmt_misc\fP equivalent
.sp
PRoot uses QEMU user\-mode to execute programs built for a CPU
architecture incompatible with the host one.  From users\(aq
point\-of\-view, guest programs handled by QEMU user\-mode are executed
transparently, that is, just like host programs.  To enable this
feature users just have to specify which instance of QEMU user\-mode
they want to use with the option \fB\-q\fP or \fB\-Q\fP (this latter implies
\fB\-B\fP):
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
proot \-r /mnt/armslack\-12.2/ \-Q qemu\-arm

$ cat /etc/motd
Welcome to ARMedSlack Linux 12.2
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The parameter of the \fB\-q/\-Q\fP option is actually a whole QEMU
user\-mode command, for instance to enable its GDB server on port
1234:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
proot \-r /mnt/armslack\-12.2/ \-Q "qemu\-arm \-g 1234" emacs
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
PRoot allows to mix transparently the emulated execution of guest
programs and the native execution of host programs in the same
file\-system namespace.  It\(aqs typically useful to extend the list of
available programs and to speed up build\-time significantly.  This
mixed\-execution feature is enabled by default when using QEMU
user\-mode, and the content of the host rootfs is made accessible
through \fB/host\-rootfs\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
proot \-r /mnt/armslack\-12.2/ \-Q qemu\-arm

$ file /bin/echo
[...] ELF 32\-bit LSB executable, ARM [...]
$ /bin/echo \(aqHello world!\(aq
Hello world!

$ file /host\-rootfs/bin/echo
[...] ELF 64\-bit LSB executable, x86\-64 [...]
$ /host\-rootfs/bin/echo \(aqHello mixed world!\(aq
Hello mixed world!
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Since both host and guest programs use the guest rootfs as \fB/\fP,
users may want to deactivate explicitly cross\-filesystem support found
in most GNU cross\-compilation tools.  For example with GCC configured
to cross\-compile to the ARM target:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
proot \-r /mnt/armslack\-12.2/ \-Q qemu\-arm

$ export CC=/host\-rootfs/opt/cross\-tools/arm\-linux/bin/gcc
$ export CFLAGS="\-\-sysroot=/"   # could be optional indeed
$ ./configure; make
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
As with regular files, a host instance of a program can be bound over
its guest instance.  Here is an example where the guest binary of
\fBmake\fP is overlaid by the host one:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
proot \-r /mnt/armslack\-12.2/ \-Q qemu\-arm \-b /usr/bin/make

$ which make
/usr/bin/make
$ make \-\-version # overlaid

.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
It\(aqs worth mentioning that even when mixing the native execution of
host programs and the emulated execution of guest programs, they still
believe they are running in a native guest environment.  As a
demonstration, here is a partial output of a typical \fB./configure\fP
script:
.INDENT 0.0

.SS Rootfs
.sp
Here follows a couple of URLs where some rootfs archives can be freely
downloaded.  Note that the errors reported by \fBtar\fP when extracting
these archives can be safely ignored.  Obviously these files are not
required when PRoot is used as a \fBmount \-\-bind\fP equivalent only.

from \fI\%http://qemu.proot.me\fP or from the host package manager under the
name of "qemu\-user" on most Linux distro.  In case one would like to
build QEMU user\-mode from sources, the \fB\-\-enable\-linux\-user\fP option
has to be specified to the \fB./configure\fP script.
