=========
 Roadmap
=========

Short term
==========

* Allow per tracee dynamic reconfiguration:

  * ``mount --bind`` under PRoot

  * ``chroot`` under PRoot


Middle term
===========

* Rewrite the way paths are handled in PRoot (branch "opath").

    * Remove the use of PATH_MAX and ARG_MAX

    * Remove most of string copy.

* Add support for a special environment variable to add paths
  dynamically to the host LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  ("EXTRA_HOST_LD_LIBRARY_PATH").

* A host program that launches a guest program shouldn't propagate its
  host LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable.

* Add a "blind" mode where:

  * unreadable executable can be executed::

    proot mount: OK (rwsr-xr-x)
    proot ping: failed (rws--x--x)

  * unreadable directory can be accessed

* Make the test-suite more portable (ARM/SH4)


Not yet scheduled
=================

Fixes
-----

* Fix path comparison: /foo and /foo/. are equal.

* Forbid rename/unlink on a mount point:

    $ mv mount_point elsewhere
    mv: cannot move "mount_point" to "elsewhere": Device or resource busy

* Fix the feature "attach on-the-fly"

* Fix support for runners that do execve()

* Add support for the string $ORIGIN (or equivalently ${ORIGIN}) in an rpath specification

* Add support for /etc/ld.so.preload and /etc/ld.so.conf[.d] in mixed-mode.

* Fix ``proot -k 1.2.3 proot -k 2.4.6 -k 3.4.5 uname -r | grep 3.4.5``.

* Don't use the same prefix for glued path::

      $ proot -b /etc/fstab -b /bin/readdir:/bin/readdir -r /tmp/empty-rootfs
      [...]
      proot info: binding = /tmp/proot-6738-CMr1hE:/bin
      proot info: binding = /tmp/proot-6738-CMr1hE:/etc
      [...]
      $ readdir /bin
      DT_DIR  ..
      DT_DIR  .
      DT_REG  readdir
      DT_REG  fstab
      $ readdir /etc
      DT_DIR  ..
      DT_DIR  .
      DT_REG  readdir
      DT_REG  fstab


Features
--------

* Add command-line interface to set environment variables.

    Rename push_env() in change_env() and enhance it to support the
    "unset" feature.

* Distinguish the runner mode ``-r/-R`` and QEMU specific modes ``-q/-Q``

* Add support for coalesced options, for instance ``proot -eM``

* Support guest ELF endianness different from the host one.

* Be more accurate on reported errno (TLPI 564-565, 572).

* Emulate ptrace() so as to allow a ptraced GDB on another ptraced process.

* Emulate get*id() and set*id() accurately when -0 is activated.

* Allow a per-module verbose level

* Emulate getdents in order to glue the "fake" branches with their
  parent directories, c.f. create_missing_components().


Documentation
-------------

* Explain what happens with unknown syscalls when using --allow-unknown-syscalls.

* Explain bindings aren't exclusive, i.e. "-b /tmp:/foo" doesn't invalidate "-b /tmp:/bar".


Clean-up
--------

* Replace "readlink(XXX, path, PATH_MAX)" with "readlink(XXX, path, PATH_MAX - 1)"

* get_tracee_string should return -ENAMETOOLONG when length(XXX) >= max_size

* Add a testcase for each command-line options


Misc.
-----

* Explain why PRoot does not work with setuid programs

* Check (in ld.so sources) if more than one RPATH/RUNPATH entry is allowed.

* Check the code coverage of PRoot


Completeness
------------

* Ensure tracees' clone flags has CLONE_PTRACE & ~CLONE_UNTRACED.

* Add a stealth mode where over-the-stack content is restored.

* Use Valgrind, Coverity Prevent, and AddressSanitizer.

* Try Scrashme (syscall fuzzer) against PRoot


Performance
-----------

* prefetch_mem(): cache write-through memory access (read_string, fetch_args).

* push_array(): use 1 iovec for the array + 1 iovec per item.

* Fallback to /proc/<pid>/mem when process_vm_readv() isn't available.

* Add a "multi-process" mode where there's one fork of PRoot per monitored process.

    Each time a new_tracee structure is created, PRoot forks itself.
    Be sure that the tracer of this new process really is the new
    forked PRoot! (Thanks Yves for this comment)

* Use a cache for translation results

* Use a hash table to retrieve cached results + tracee's info
