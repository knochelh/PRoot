		 *    allocates the heap segment for this loader, not
		 *    for the application.  It isn't really a problem
		 *    since the application re-uses the loader's heap
		 *    transparently, i.e. its own brk points there.
		 *
		 * 2. When the current stack limit is set to a "high"
		 *    value, the ELF interpreter is loaded to a "low"
		 *    address, I guess it is the way the Linux kernel
		 *    deals with this constraint.
		 *
		 * This two behaviors can be observed by running the
		 * command "/usr/bin/cat /proc/self/maps", with/out
		 * the ELF interpreter and with/out a high current
		 * stack limit.
		 *
		 * When this two behaviors are combined, the dynamic
		 * ELF linker might mmap a shared libraries to the
		 * same address as the start of its heap if no heap
		 * allocation was made prior this mmap.  This problem
		 * was first observed with something similar to the
		 * example below (because GNU make sets the current
		 * limit to the maximum):
		 *
		 *     #!/usr/bin/make -f
		 *
		 *     SHELL=/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 /usr/bin/bash
		 *     FOO:=$(shell test -e /dev/null && echo OK)
		 *
		 *     all:
		 *            @/usr/bin/test -n "$(FOO)"
		 *
		 * The code below is a workaround to this wrong
		 * combination of behaviors, however it might create
		 * conflict with tools that assume a "standard" stack
		 * layout, like libgomp and QEMU.
