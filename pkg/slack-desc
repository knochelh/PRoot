proot: proot (chroot, mount --bind, and binfmt_misc without any privilege)
proot:
proot: PRoot is a user-space implementation of chroot, mount --bind,
proot: and binfmt_misc.  This means that users don't need any
proot: privilege or setup to do things like: using an arbitrary
proot: directory as the new root file-system or making files
proot: accessible somewhere else in the file-system hierarchy or
proot: executing programs built for another CPU architecture
proot: transparently through QEMU.  Technically PRoot relies on
proot: ptrace, an unprivileged system-call available in every Linux
proot: kernel.
